## Response

```md

After receiving a mobile push message at 10:26, Kristian Green came online at 10:28 in GrafanaCloud.
Kristian Green did not come online immediately after receiving the sms message because it
wasn't noticed until the push message arrived.
```

## Root cause

```md
A chaos monkey was injected into the connection between the server and the factory,
resulting in all purchase requests to fail due to having no connection with the factory.
```

## Resolution

```md
The service was restored when Kristian Green found the chaos monkey in the factory response
and sent a report so that the connectioncould be reestablished by following the provided url
in the error response contained in the logs.
```
## Prevention
```md
When the server is unable to send creation requests to the factory, it could automatically follow the url given in the error response to
send a report and reestablish the connection with the pizza factory.

On an unrelated note to this incident, but for a potential way to increase observation,
proper alerts should be established for the revenue service as well, in case
revenue is not received for pizza purchases.
